  - **Task Impact**: +0% to TODO: #1 (+0% overall).
  - **Summary**: Existing header naming cleanup; no Venus transport implementation.
- **Commit `5398e3f`**: `docs(vgpu): specify IVSHMEM ring transport contract`
  - **Task Impact**: +10% to TODO: #1 (+1.5% overall).
  - **Summary**: Defined cache-isolated C ABI, bounded Zig validation, SPSC ordering,
    errors, ownership, milestones, and transport-versus-renderer boundary.

The current entry is identified by its unique commit subject because a commit
cannot contain its own content-derived hash. Each following atomic commit records
the preceding entry's actual hash; `git log` resolves the latest entry directly.

- **Commit `59829ff`**: `feat(vgpu): implement bounded SPSC byte transport`
  - **Task Impact**: +35% to TODO: #1 (+5.25% overall).
  - **Summary**: Added the 192-byte C11 ABI, cache-isolated cursors, local capacity
    snapshots, allocation-free Zig validation/copy helpers, and basic tests.
  - **Verification**: `make vgpu-test vgpu-sanitizers` passed with ASan/LSan/UBSan;
    Zig allocator tests passed; Windows x86-64 C object compilation passed.
    Native Windows execution, stress, coverage, and session adapters remain pending.

- **Commit `b071cc8`**: `test(vgpu): exercise corruption and concurrent ring rollover`
  - **Task Impact**: +15% to TODO: #1 (+2.25% overall).
  - **Summary**: Exhausted every ring start and bounded transfer length, corrupted
    all ABI identity/padding bytes, verified capacity snapshots and error output
    preservation, and transferred 3.1 MB in both thread and independent-process
    stress starting near 32-bit rollover. Both stress variants have a deadline.
  - **Verification**: `make vgpu-test vgpu-sanitizers` passed; Zig allocator
    tests returned all allocations. Coverage and native adapters remain pending.

- **Commit `9ee99e0`**: `test(vgpu): gate C and Zig transport coverage`
  - **Task Impact**: +5% to TODO: #1 (+0.75% overall).
  - **Summary**: Added gcov gates for production C lines and branches, reused the
    repository LLVM instrumentation for Zig validation/copy routines, and added
    reproducible Windows test cross-link targets. Coverage excludes compiler
    panic guards but includes source validation errors.
  - **Verification**: C production line/branch coverage 100%; Zig production
    line/branch coverage 100%. Native CI remains pending.

- **Commit `63862ff`**: `chore(vgpu): verify transport on Linux and native Windows CI`
  - **Task Impact**: +0% to TODO: #1 (+0% overall); CI verification pending.
  - **Summary**: Added feature-branch Linux safety/stress/coverage and native
    Windows ABI/allocator jobs with pinned tools and bounded runtime.
    This verifies transport only; renderer, WDDM, presentation, and OpenCL
    integration remain required for feature completion.

- **Commit `bfc1bb5`**: `chore(deps): pin virglrenderer 1.2.0 for Venus execution`
  - **Task Impact**: +40% to TODO: #6 (+2.0% overall).
  - **Summary**: Added public HTTPS MIT-licensed renderer dependency at immutable
    `500b41d5c8638f9b80dd558f4044f3301c7457a4`; allocated a dedicated dependency
    task by splitting 5% from unimplemented TODO #2. No guest or GPU completion
    is implied by the dependency pin.

- **Commit `bca923e`**: `chore(vgpu): build pinned Venus renderer offline`
  - **Task Impact**: +40% to TODO: #6 (+2.0% overall); +5% to TODO: #1
    (+0.75% overall) for native transport CI verification.
  - **Summary**: Added deterministic Meson/Ninja targets with wrap downloads
    disabled and base-package build prerequisites; synchronized the dependency
    in the Linux job. Built the full Venus-enabled renderer locally.
  - **Verification**: Transport Linux and native Windows jobs both succeeded at
    `63862ff` in https://github.com/Kayyo321/Waddle-LSW/actions/runs/37385937849 .
    Dependency CI for this commit remains pending; this is not a rendering test.

- **Commit `b993e78`**: `feat(vgpu): define bidirectional dedicated IVSHMEM region`
  - **Task Impact**: +5% to TODO: #1 (+0.75% overall); +20% to TODO: #6
    (+1.0% overall) for verified dependency CI.
  - **Summary**: Added a 64-byte immutable region ABI, separate command/reply
    rings, a bounded resource area, single-snapshot Zig extent validation, and
    all-or-nothing local attachment. Added portable fixtures and native CI checks.
  - **Verification**: Ring lines/branches 100%; region lines 100%, branches
    96.15%; combined Zig validation/copy lines 100%, branches 97.5%. Sanitizers
    and allocator tests pass. Dependency CI succeeded at `bca923e` in
    https://github.com/Kayyo321/Waddle-LSW/actions/runs/37386229779 .
    Dedicated driver-backed host/guest integration is still pending.

- **Commit (current; resolve by subject)**: `feat(vgpu): own sealed Linux IVSHMEM backing mappings`
  - **Task Impact**: +5% to TODO: #1 (+0.75% overall).
  - **Summary**: Created dedicated memfd-backed BAR ownership with resize seals,
    shared mmap, deterministic free, and preserved errno. Defined the native
    mapping API and Windows ownership contract for the next atomic implementation.
  - **Verification**: Real dual mapping exchanges commands/replies; all six
    injected acquisition/post-map failures release resources. Linux mapping
    line/branch coverage 100%; ASan/LSan/UBSan and Zig allocator tests pass.
